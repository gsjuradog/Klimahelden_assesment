# small react application

1. Explain in approximately 5 minutes the following of the react app:

   - its functionality to the user
   - its components
   - its structure

2. We would now like to the extent the existing application by showing posts that can be fetched from the following json api:

   - https://dummyapi.io/data/api/post
     - the URL parameter 'limit' can be used to limit the number of elements returned
     - the URL parameter 'page' can be used to query different
     - for authentication, we need to send a header 'app-id' with the value '60487454c1428373e71694de'

3. The app should now provide the ability to paginate through the posts
   - The app should display 10 posts per page
   - For the current page number you can reuse the counter from the beginning
